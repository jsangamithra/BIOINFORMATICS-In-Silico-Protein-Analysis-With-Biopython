STEP 5: FUNCTIONAL ANNOTATION
------------------------------

Top BLAST Hit Information:
Hit ID: ref|WP_012299000.1|
Hit Description: MULTISPECIES: alkaline phosphatase family protein [Clavibacter] >gb|MBD5381593.1| alkaline phosphatase family protein [Clavibacter sp.] >gb|MGJ1427782.1| alkaline phosphatase family protein [Clavibacter sepedonicus] >gb|MGJ1463945.1| alkaline phosphatase family protein [Clavibacter sepedonicus] >gb|MGJ1467117.1| alkaline phosphatase family protein [Clavibacter sepedonicus] >gb|MGJ1478830.1| alkaline phosphatase family protein [Clavibacter sepedonicus]
Alignment Length: 379
E-value: 0.0
Bit Score: 1917.0
Percent Identity: 100.00%

Functional Inference:
Based on the high sequence similarity to the top BLAST hit, the query protein (uniprot_id = 'B0RC17') is predicted to have a similar molecular function and biological role as the matched protein. This annotation is inferred computationally and requires experimental validation.
